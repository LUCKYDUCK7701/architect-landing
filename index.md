## ❌ The Problem

Unstructured prompts lead to unpredictable results.  
Most AI agents are built on vague instructions, causing inconsistent outputs, hallucinations, or wasted VCUs. Even skilled developers struggle to scale their prompts across different agents or tasks.

---

## ✅ The Solution: A.R.C.H.I.T.E.C.T.

A.R.C.H.I.T.E.C.T. is a 9-part framework that gives your prompts structure, clarity, and consistency.

| Component     | Purpose                                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **A – Action**      | What should the AI do? (Explain, generate, summarize)       |
| **R – Role**        | What role should the AI take? (Expert, analyst, teacher)     |
| **C – Context**     | What background does the AI need to know?                  |
| **H – How to Output** | What format? (Table, Markdown, bullet list, JSON)         |
| **I – Instructions** | What constraints? (Word count, banned phrases, etc.)       |
| **T – Tone**        | What style? (Formal, friendly, direct, persuasive)         |
| **E – Examples**    | Show examples to guide the output                          |
| **C – Constraints** | Budget, hardware, location, or domain-specific rules        |
| **T – Testing**     | Use meta-prompting to critique or improve the prompt        |

This format is designed to integrate directly with Venice-native agents, helping you deliver structured logic that works predictably—every time.
